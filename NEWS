Overview Of Changes In mtn-browse 1.00-RC2 (2012-02-05 16:20:00)
================================================================

New:
- Implemented an `Open Recent' menu.
- mtn-browse now accepts one custom argument on the command line, the name of
  the database to open.
- Now allow Monotone style URLs when connecting to remote servers.

Changes:
- The history graph button is now enabled for remote connections.
- Standardised some warning messages.
- Updated the README file with new dependency information and an explanation of
  the `Use Gtk2::Labels' installer option.
- Updated the help file to include details about the new changes and also
  making some unrelated corrections.

Defects Fixed:
- The `day of month' value is adjusted if incorrect when adjusting time by
  months or years. For example going forward by a month from 31/01/2012 should
  yield 29/01/2012 and not 31/02/2012.
- Better diagnostics when opening databases.
- Now reset the progress bar just before displaying the nothing found dialog
  window when doing custom queries via the advanced find dialog window. This
  prevents the progress bar from being shown in it's pulsed state when the
  dialog window is displayed.
- Selected but suspended branches are now included in any list of selected
  branches in the change history graph dialog window.
- Now correctly save and restore change graph history date/time range values
  when switching between history graphs. Also cancelling out of the change
  history graph dialog window reverts any date/time range settings to those
  last used.
- Now reset the option widgets to the current settings when displaying the
  change history graph dialog window.


Overview Of Changes In mtn-browse 1.00-RC1 (2011-12-28 16:40:00)
================================================================

New:
- Implemented a fully functional, fast, integrated history graph facility that
  replaces the need for monotone-viz.
- Implemented a custom auto-completion entry setup that is much more efficient
  than using a simple ComboBoxEntry widget. This is now used on all branch,
  revision and directory entry fields.
- Added a `browse file' option to the annotate menu like we have in the history
  graph window.

Changes:
- Made meld the default external comparison tool.
- Got rid of the static lists option under preferences as this is no longer
  needed with the new entry auto-completion setup.
- Updated the help to take into account the new history change graph window and
  the new auto-completion entry fields.
- Implemented the pulsing of progress bars when waiting for Monotone or running
  some external command. Applied this to advanced find queries, revision and
  file comparisons, annotations and running dot.
- Removed redundant frames in the more simple windows so as to save on screen
  real-estate.
- All date/time strings with the exception of those entered via the helper
  widgets in the advanced find window are now displayed in a locale specific
  way and in the local time.
- All modal dialogs now put the application into a busy state to make it
  clearer to the user what is going on.
- The application no longer exits when mtn crashes. On balance this is probably
  more helpful to the user.
- Added a patch file that can be applied to switch mtn-browse over to using
  Gtk2::SourceView2 instead of the now deprecated Gtk2::SourceView. This will
  be applied by the installer.
- Now detects which version of Gtk2::SourceView is in use and uses the
  appropriate source files.
- Also changed the installer so that it will patch files if needed when run.
- Made the advanced find update granularity coarser. It now updates at
  approximately double the speed.
- Made the update interval when loading a list much coarser, speeds things up a
  lot.
- Now no longer have a dependency on Gnome2::Print (there should never have
  been one).

Defects Fixed:
- Now correctly enable and disable the text entry and date edit widgets
  depending upon the type of selector chosen in the advanced find window.
- Made the file name column in the main browser window unresizable when not
  displaying a detailed listing.
- To dates are now rounded up when loading date-time widgets as they truncate
  to the nearest minute.
- Corrected uninitialised bug found by Thomas K.
- Now use the blessed() routine and the isa() method to determine whether a
  parameter is just a hash reference or a Gtk2::Dialog window. Using isa as a
  routine is deprecated in later versions of Perl.
- Now escape special characters such as /| and \ in selection strings passed to
  Monotone via Monotone::AutomateStdio.
- Operators are no longer escaped when they are inserted into advanced find
  queries.
- Switched the tooltips around for the revision selection buttons in a revision
  history window.
- Switched off bracket highlighting (this was responsible for that little grey
  blob in the SourceView text window).
- Corrected some existing tooltips.


Overview Of Changes In mtn-browse 0.72 (2011-02-20 10:40:00)
============================================================

New:
- Implemented the `Restrict to' combobox feature in the history window so that
  a user can restrict a revision/file history to a selected branch.
- Added the new selectors and selector functions introduced in Monotone 0.99.1.

Changes:
- If supported, now use the get_extended_manifest_of() method for getting a
  revision's manifest instead of the get_manifest_of() method. This can
  considerably speed up certain operations.
- The scrolling lists associated with the main browser window and the
  advanced find dialog window now have their column sorting settings reset when
  that window is resued.
- Updated the built-in help to document the new selectors introduced in
  Monotone version 0.99.1 and the new `Restricted to' comboxbox on the history
  window.
- Updated all of the screenshot style images to update them to Gnome's
  Clearlooks blue theme.

Defects Fixed:
- Now guard against going off the end of the line input array when dealing with
  binary files at the end of a revision difference listing.
- Re-instated the `==========' style file separators when displaying non-colour
  highlighted, i.e. plain, revision difference listings.
- Icon column in the scrolling list in a browser window is now allowed to
  choose its own size.
- Corrected a mistake with one of the message dialogs where I didn't pass the
  correct number of parameters.


Overview Of Changes In mtn-browse 0.71 (2010-08-18 09:57:00)
============================================================

New:
- Added the ability for a user to select an authorisation key when connecting
  to remote databases.

Changes:
- Updated to take into account the changes in diff output made in
  Monotone version 0.48.
- Made the text cursor in branch and directory ComboBox entry fields move to
  the end on update as it is more useful to display the end of a branch or path
  name rather than the beginning.
- Updated the help documentation and the translation files in light of the
  changes made to mtn-browse.

Defects Fixed:
- The ComboBoxEntry autocompletion and directory up button now display `busy'
  state feedback along with status messages when updating ComboBoxEntry
  pulldown lists. Also the display is updated more often and more consistently.
- The directory up button now honours the static list setting.


Overview Of Changes In mtn-browse 0.70 (2010-05-31 14:50:00)
============================================================

New:
- Added support for connecting to networked Monotone servers, this also
  includes a bookmark and bookmark manager features.
- Added support for comparing any two arbitrary revisions in a database.
- Added a View menu that allows the user to select the character encoding in
  use inside text files stored inside a Monotone database rather than just
  assume it is UTF-8.

Changes:
- The revision comparison window now allows a user to stop the comparison not
  only during the formatting stage but also during the actual mtn diff
  operation as well.
- Improved some of the messages in error dialogs.
- Improved and corrected a few tooltips and removed some others that are
  dynamically generated by the application.
- Now a bit more explicit about the error handing from the character
  encode/decode routines. The character decoding is now handled more
  specifically for files.
- Updated the help documentation and the translation files in light of the
  changes made to mtn-browse.

Defects Fixed:
- Worked around a bug in Gnome::VFS which causes a core dump on Debian Lenny.
- All menu items that rely on an open database are now disabled when there
  isn't one.
- Now guard against re-entrancy in custom dialog windows when calling the
  hide() method.
- Needless updates to the MIME types treeview are now avoided.
- Now track changes in paths inside the MIME treeview as a result of the user
  changing the display order.
- Sorted out the focus issue with all TreeViews when searching for text (the
  selection would change but nothing else acted on that selection change).
- Now deal with errors resulting from trying to open a Monotone database in a
  much more intelligent way.


Overview Of Changes In mtn-browse 0.63 (2009-11-08 13:53:00)
============================================================

New:
- Contents differences are now done via the stdio i/f for Monotone version 0.45
  and upwards.
- Added the binary threshold preference option.
- Added a tooltip feedback feature for auto-completing comboboxentry widgets
  and associated preference options.
- Added a preference option for listing folders before files instead of
  alphabetically in directory listings.
- Made some of the button icons more meaningful and improved the look of some
  of the rest.
- Added the `Multiple Revisions' dialog window and use it when either a tag has
  been selected which is not unique on that branch or when auto select head
  revision is switched on and the user switches to a multi-headed branch.
- Implemented a mode where help is displayed using the desktop's web browser.
  Just in case yelp is not installed on the system (as is the case with Apple
  Mac OSX).
- The installers now cope with HTML stype help files. Also added the
  HTML_VIEWER/--help-viewer installation option and updated the dependencies.
- Added the FILE_COMPARISON installation option.

Changes:
- Moved the location of the Glade files to be more inline with standard Linux
  installation locations.
- Updated the help documentation in light of the changes made to the GUI.
- Re-ordered some preference settings into more logical groups.
- Updated the POT file.
- Locale update from Thomas Keller.

Defects Fixed:
- History ordering is now consistent.
- Now guard against files comparing the same between different revisions.
- Autocompletion now does not allow "" as a valid complete entry against an
  empty list of possible completions.
- The autocompletion logic has been cleaned up some more so as not to make
  unnecesary updates to the screen and to correctly detect completions when
  deleting text from the end of a term and the static lists setting is turned
  on.
- Truncated completions are still marked as complete if the truncated value is
  so.
- The status bar is cleared out when opening another database.
- Now check that a program is known before attempting to run it. If it isn't
  known then tell the user via a dialog window.
- UTF-8 handling now works correctly.
- More robust process and interprocess handling.
- Set the page size attribute on all spin buttons to zero. This stops warning
  messages on Ubuntu.

============================================================

New:
- Added the new relevant selectors introduced in Monotone 0.43.
- Implemented the help sub-system and wrote the manual. This not only supports
  displaying the help manual but also `help on window' and `context sensitive
  help' features.
- Added the home page help menu option.
- Added a user preference option for determining how a list search is done
  (either plain text or as a re).
- Added user preference options for controlling the look of the toolbar.
- Added Thomas Keller's German locale file for mtn-browse.

Changes:
- Implemented a caching class derived from Monotone::AutomateStdio for caching
  branch list information. Switched the rest of the application over to this
  new class.
- Now weed out unsupported selectors from the GUI depending upon the version of
  Monotone being used.
- Gtk2::FileChooserDialog dialog windows now have their current directory
  location saved between invocations.
- Enabled the use of the Find Text dialog window within the Advanced Find
  dialog window.
- References to MIME are now correctly in upper case.
- Corrected spelling of cronologically to chronologically.
- Reinstated the Gnome save window settings setting.
- Now display a file's author instead of file id in the main browser window.
- Renamed the `Separator' selector to `Logical And', it makes more sense.

Defects Fixed:
- Added calls to the present() method after each call to show()/show_all() for
  each window (fixes the focus issue with windows not shown by default on
  desktops that use click to focus).
- Started using the update method on spinbuttons in order to make sure that
  their internal state is consistent.
- Corrected a few stack handling issues in the WindowManager class.
- mtn-browse now correctly gets the name of the database from a workspace
  regardless of the user's `auto_select' setting.
- When a single file is selected for comparison, the results window is now
  scrolled to that file.
- Fixed a bug whereby the external file comparison button remained enabled when
  a lone binary file was selected for comparison.


Overview Of Changes In mtn-browse 0.61 (2009-02-08 18:00:00)
============================================================

New:
- Annotate window now offers a lot more options via its menu for accessing file
  and revision change logs and comparing between the current file or revision
  its parent version.
- Added a user preference option for controlling whether line numbers are
  displayed by default when showing a file's contents.
- Added a user preference option for controlling whether branch and revision
  comboboxentries update their lists when the user is typing in values (a
  performance tuning option).
- Implemented the option of selecting a search column in a treeview widget.
- Searching in a treeview now uses REs.
- Added installation via `perl Makefile.PL'.

Changes:
- Vertical panes now maintain the size of the left hand window.
- A scroll margin is now used when finding text. This makes it easier to see
  the context of a found string when it is at the top or bottom of the window.
- Beefed up linux-install, now called linux-installer. It now:
  - Can take all its information from the command line.
  - Supports the concept of DESTDIR.
  - Checks that Perl dependencies have been met.
  - Has built in help.
- Switched all Perl scripts over to demanding Perl 5.8.5.
- README file has been updated as a result of the changes in linux-installer.

Defects Fixed:
- Now a little bit better at reporting helper application launch errors to the
  user.
- Annotate no longer fails on an empty file.
- Annotate and comparisons are no longer affected by where the application is
  run inside a workspace.
- mtn-browse now always explicitly opens a database rather than relying on the
  mtn subprocess sorting itself out inside a workspace. This is much safer.
- Database locked dialog windows are no longer parented.
- Now guard against no external comparison helper application being setup.
- Directory separators are no longer assumed to be '/'.
- The get_revision_ids routine now correctly uses the current branch to refine
  the query (can now cope with multiple tags on different branches).

============================================================
- Pretty much works on Linux. First release of this application.
